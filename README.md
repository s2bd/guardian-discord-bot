# Guardian, Discord bot template
A multi-purpose Discord bot, intended for administrative purposes. (Work in progress)
Also can be defined as a defender bot that auto-deletes NSFW and/or swear words. He insults back if anyone is too rude or offensive.

# Restrictions
Currently there are no specified restrictions from my behalf except a kind suggestion NOT to use the logging features of this bot!
