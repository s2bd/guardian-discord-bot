# Guardian, Discord bot template
A multi-purpose Discord bot, intended for administrative purposes. (Work in progress)
Also can be defined as a defender bot that auto-deletes NSFW and/or swear words. He insults back if anyone is too rude or offensive.

### Restrictions
Currently there are no specified restrictions from my behalf except a kind suggestion NOT to use the logging features of this bot!

## How to Run

- Download the source code via the `<> Code` button then `Download ZIP` or if you are comfortable with a CLI/Terminal, then just copy the commmand.
- Download the dependencies:
```ruby
pip install discord requests flask
```
- Run by:
```python
python3 main.py
```
If you get something like this, it's working fine 👍

> [!NOTE]
> For recent Python3 versions on Linux, you may have to create a virtual environment to download external libraries/packages via `pip install *`

To set up a virtual env, follow these steps:
```python
python3 -m venv bot_env
```
```bash
source bot_env/bin/activate
```
And now you can easily type the `pip install _` commands.

## Or... Just get the original bot
